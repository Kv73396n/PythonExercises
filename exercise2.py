# A. Out of range
# B. 1.0
# C. 0.0
# A returned a value that was too large of a integer value to print or compute correctly.
# B was a normal expression, but it kept the decimal places as in the original expression. 
# C is 0.0 because it is being rounded off by Python. The answer to this expression is so small it can be considered 0.
